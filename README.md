Project Overview
This project modernizes a legacy VXML-based IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system by integrating it with a Conversational AI stack. The goal is to enhance user experience with natural language capabilities, while maintaining compatibility with existing ACS/BAP platforms and legacy telephony workflows.
The modernization process is completed across four structured modules:
Legacy Analysis
Integration Layer
Conversational AI Development
Testing & Deployment
Module 1: Legacy System Analysis & Requirements Gathering
Objective
Assess the existing VXML IVR system and identify all technical, functional, and integration requirements for modernization.
Tasks
Review architecture, behavior, and capabilities of legacy IVR implementations
Document integration needs to align with ACS and BAP platforms
Identify technical gaps, constraints, and compatibility issues
Capture current call flows, backend interactions, and system dependencies
Module 2: Integration Layer Development
Objective
Build a middleware/API layer enabling seamless communication between VXML-based IVRs and the Conversational AI stack.
Tasks
Design and implement connectors/APIs for communication between VXML and ACS/BAP
Ensure support for real-time data handling and request/response compatibility
Validate the integration layer using sample transactions and flow tests
Ensure extensibility for future conversational capabilities
Module 3: Conversational AI Interface Development
Objective
Introduce natural language understanding and conversation-driven flows into the legacy IVR system.
Tasks
Develop conversational dialogue flows aligned with existing IVR logic
Map intent-based flows to legacy transaction structures
Integrate conversational flows into existing IVR architecture
Enable real-time voice input/output processing through the Conversational AI engine
Ensure smooth interoperability with ACS/BAP platforms
Module 4: Testing & Deployment
Objective
Perform full validation and deploy the upgraded IVR system into production environments.
Tasks
Conduct end-to-end system testing for performance, accuracy, latency, and call-flow coverage
Validate voice interactions, intent detection, and fallback handling
Deploy and monitor the integrated system in production
Track post-deployment behavior, optimize system performance, and resolve issues
